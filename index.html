        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>When I am not working, one of my favorite things to do to unwind is get on my motorcycle and go for a nice ride on the twisty roads in the country.
        There is nothing like the feeling of freedom you get from being on two wheels with the wind in your face.</p>
        <p>My other passion to unwind is scuba diving.  There is nothing like the feeling of swimming with the creatures of the ocean. One of my most favourite diving experiences
         was a night time dive with the large Manta Rays off the coast of the Big Island of Hawaii.</p>
